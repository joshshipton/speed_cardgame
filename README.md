Speed is a fast-paced, two-player card game that requires quick reflexes and sharp focus. The objective of the game is to get rid of all your cards before your opponent does. Each player is dealt a set of cards, which they arrange into two piles in front of them. The game begins when both players simultaneously flip over their top card onto a central pile. From there, players race to play cards onto two separate piles in the center of the table, each pile going in ascending or descending order depending on the pile. Players can play as many cards as they can onto the center piles until they cannot make any more moves. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game.
